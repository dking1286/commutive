        We often don't recognize the amount of time, money, and
        energy that our daily commute takes away form us. Every moment
        that we spend behind the wheel of a car is a moment that we could
        have used to improve our lives in some other way.
        <br /><br />

        To calculate the <em>true</em> cost of your commute, it is necessary
        to take into account not only the direct cost in dollars, but to
        also account for all of the opportunities that we miss while
        we are sitting motionless inside our vehicles.
        <br /><br />

        Your monthly commute cost is estimated by combining the EPA average
        direct dollar cost of your commute and the <em>opportunity cost </em>
        of the time that you spent behind the wheel, based on how much you
        are paid per hour of work.<br />
